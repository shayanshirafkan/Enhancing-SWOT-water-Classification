README: Water/Land Classification Using XGBoost
Steps to Run the Code

1. Prepare Input Matrices (A and A5)
Run the demo code to generate:

Matrix A: Training data (features + labeled classes: water/land).

Matrix A5: Input data for prediction (unlabeled features).

2. Train and Predict with XGBoost
Run XGB.ipynb in Python.

Key variables:

x (line 4): Time-series word features (e.g., 15 Khordad Dam data for the first 5 intervals).

y: Class labels (water/land).

Model Evaluation:

Lines 1–8 evaluate model accuracy.

Input for Prediction:

In line 7, load A5 (prediction data) into the trained model.

Output: Predicted classes are saved as PD.tex.

3. Visualize and Analyze Results
Run the read code to:

Display predicted classes visually.

Calculate the area of water/land regions in UTM coordinates.

4. Repeat for All Input Data
Execute steps 2–4 sequentially for each input dataset.

5. Validation & Accuracy Metrics
Ground Truth: in-situ matrix contains validation labels.

Accuracy Functions:

norms: Normalized error metrics.

kgef: Kernel-based goodness-of-fit.
